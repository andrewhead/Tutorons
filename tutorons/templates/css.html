<h5>You found a CSS selector.</h5>
<p>
    {{ exp }}
</p>
<p>
    <i>If you haven't seen them before</i>, selectors choose sections of HTML by their names or properties.
    Once you've 'grabbed' these elements with a selector, you can manipulate them, like changing their appearance or text.
</p>
<p>
    Here's an example of what this selector will find:
</p>
<div class='example-code'>
{% if example %}{{ example|safe }}{% endif %}
</div>
